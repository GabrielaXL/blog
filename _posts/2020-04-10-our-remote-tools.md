 Staying connected and productive, specially during this quarantine, can be a tough. Particularly if we consider everyone at Xmartlabs was forced to stay at home and work from there.

Since our very beginning, at Xmartlabs, as a software consultancy company, we have been working remotely with our clients due to geographic limitations. Also each team member has the freedom to work from home if desired or needed.
Considering that we want to share the tools we use that allowed us to stay productive and connected during covid-19 quarantine.

Despite we have already adopted remote working on a daily basis, work from home bring up some challenges and also opens up the possibility of creating positive changes and increased collaboration amongst teams.

Before I dip into the tools I would like to introduce some of the benefits everyone able to adopt remote working will be benefit of.

* Will be easier to hire talent all over the world. Offering remote working a company becomes more attractive to top talent all over the world.
* Will be easier to expand business presence in other markets.
* Having the team in different time zones we eventually can provide 24/7 services.
* Gain cultural insights and different perspectives.
* Companies all over the world will feel confortable collaborating remotely and more willing to work with us.

There are a lot more benefits we can enumerate, but at the same time there are huge amount of challenges to overcome to manage a distribute team working efficiently.
So, in this blogpost I will enumerate 10 tools that makes our live easier when working from home.

### Time tracking tool

#### Toggl

A time tracking tool for teams. By using it we accurately track how long it takes to get a task done. Also it provides some cool reports when we can see profits agains time spent and we can see which project /client is more profitable.

### Project management tools

#### Trello

Trello help us on project, tasks management. It's simple, like a board indicating what have to be done, what's in progress and what's done. We can easily visualize what needs to get done and aggregate feedback and comments.

#### Jira

A project manager tool for software teams that follow agile approach. Task and release planning, releases and reports are just few of the functionalities provided by jira. It takes more time to set up it so it's recommendable for ongoing or long term software projects.

### Communication Tools

#### Slack

Slack is one of the most widely used tools by remote teams where team members can get instant feedback and connect with their colleagues, both one-on-one and in groups. It organizes conversations into channels where team members can join and leave. It also provide conversation threads that makes easier to follow a conversation and also have more than one conversation on the same channel.
One feature that stands out is the ability to install apps that automatically report on business activity, like new pull request to github, new deployed app version, and any kind of bots that help keep teams engaged.

#### Discord

We onboard on Discord just few weeks ago. Discord also provides communication channels/rooms like Slack but its strengths is different. It provides one of the best room voice communication and we can easily communicate using voice with different teams or feel like we were in the same room.  

#### Zoom

It's a video conferencing app. We use it mainly for our team informal hangouts. One fun feature is gallery view, which allows you to view everyone on the video conference at once and makes it feel, for a moment, like our remote team is close together!‚Äù

#### Google Hangouts

It's a video conferencing app we normally use to work and communicate with our clients.


### Document collaboration tools

#### Google Drive

Google drive is well know set of tools to edit and collaborate over basic documents like text files, spreadsheets, presentations, etc. It's like Microsoft Office in the cloud that works perfectly for remote teams. It also provides cloud storage apart of document collaboration tools.

#### Notion

We mainly use notion as our company's long term memory and playbook. Every documentation, guide, training, process of the company are added in a particular notion section so it's easily to keep everything accessible and well organized.

### Code hosting and code collaboration

#### Github

If a engineer had to choose one developer tool, probably this would be GitHub. It's not just git in the cloud, it provides us with a full range of collaborative tools and integrations. We not only host our code in GitHub but we also review it and it allows us to collaborate in order to produce a high quality software products.


&nbsp;

We still have many other remote collaborative tools to enumerate but these are the most important ones.
We strongly rely on these tools to collaborate remotely and with distribute teams.
You may think, this is a huge amount of tools but each one serves in a different purposes and all together allows us to easily collaborate and be productive in a distributed team.

Hope it helps you to choose the right tools that maximize your team productivity!!

See you in the next post!!!
