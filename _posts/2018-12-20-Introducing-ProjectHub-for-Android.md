ProjectHub is an app that lets you manage your GitHub projects. 
You only need to log in with your GitHub account! 
In this post, we will talk briefly about the key functionality of the app, so that you can start taking full advantage of it immediately.

#### Browse your repositories

Browse through all of your repositories, including forks and the ones from organizations. 
The app also offers filters so that you can select an organization -should you have more than one- to browse only through that organization's repositories.

#### Import or create projects

Select an existing project and import it to your device to start working on it or create a new one from scratch. 

#### Manage your imported projects

Create, move, rename and delete columns and cards from your imported projects. 
Everything you can do from GitHub you can do easily from ProjectHub.
